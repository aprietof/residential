= How Coming Soon Page Works =

While your site is under construction, Coming Soon page allows you to set up landing page that users will be directed to when visiting any of your site page. The Coming Soon by Supsystic plugin has three modes, "Coming Soon", "Maintenance / Under Construction" and "Redirect".
The design and front-end of your site will not look exactly when you activate coming soon page. The Coming Soon page or Launch page will be open to search engines and users, while Maintenance / Underconstruction mode will inform search engines that your site temporarily is under construction.

You can completely customize the look of your coming soon page just by selecting a few options. You can add a background image to the coming soon page, change text and link color, add a personal message using a drag-and-drop coming soon builder or customize CSS. The outputted coming soon page is completely responsive (if enabled) and your coming soon page will be mobile friendly by default. After you enable Coming Soon, users will be greeted with your custom landing page no matter where they enter the site, until you decide to remove coming soon page. Logged in administrators, however, will still be able to view a site like normal not in coming soon mode.

= Under Construction Mode =

Any startup can benefit from setting up a coming soon page as early as possible. But the other way is to setup Under Construction Mode on your website. With Under Construction \ Maintenance mode turned on, only you can see your site when you are logged in to WordPress as an Administrator. And all other users will see your coming soon page, until you end editing site in maintenance mode and turn this mode off.

There're options to remove Under Construction and Maintenance modes not only for Administrators but for other user roles or special URLs. That options is also available when you setup Coming Soon or Launch page.

= Video Landing Pages and Coming Soon Pages =

Build video landing pages and coming soon pages with the Coming Soon page by Supsystic plugin. Putting a Video on a landing page or coming soon page is agreat way for helping visitors get your message clearly. The best way to build a video landing page or coming soon page is to host the video on a video hosting site like youtube.com or Vimeo. Then embed the video in your landing page or coming soon page.

Coming soon pages are best used for collecting emails while your website is underconstruction . Focused message on your coming soon page can help you. Sometimes there can be a tendency to try and keep the launch page message broad on a coming soon page. Sometimes it's not correct.

When you send the right traffic to your coming soon page and have the right message, you will get higher conversions. Focus on your target-group visitors on your coming soon page.

You also want to make sure you include a sign-up form on your coming soon page. You will spend a lot of money to get visitors to your coming soon page. Coming soon pages can also be used to quickly validate an idea. For instance, you believe that a booked idea you have will sell well. Instead of writing the book, creating a full website, and marketing the book; you can start with a coming soon page and see what kind of responses you will get.
